You need to buy a house for your parents. Being an expert Data Scientist you got some
data points of the houses in your locality and now have to work on finding your parents
their desired home.
However your parents are testing your knowledge and have told you to implement the
model from scratch and not use any library for the algorithm.
Your parentâ€™s choice: 3 bedrooms, 2 floors and something built in 1982. Estimate and
tell them the price of their choice.
Come up with a few insights as well.
